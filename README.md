# kinectCap

Simple script to dump Kinect camera screen captures to disk, to be reused on other processing sketches or aplications.

Originally made to work-around a compatibility bug between the Fisica and SimpleOpenNI libraries. It sacrificies performance for flexibility. This script is deprecated and not recommended for general usage with Processing, don't expect it to follow good coding practices.
